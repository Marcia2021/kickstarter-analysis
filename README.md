# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Fundraising is one of the most important steps to make a play to be performed on big stage. There are
different factors that will affect the successfulness of the fundraising campaign. For example, based
on different country and time period, the goal of fundraising might be affected by the timeline. A
thorough data analysis will help the owner to have a reasonable expectation and make decision on the 
fundraising campaign.
As Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal soon, we are going to analyze the Kickstarter
data to help Louise better understand the relationship between launch date or funding goals and the
fundraising campaign outcomes. This analysis will help Louise to gather additional information to
success fundraising campaign.
